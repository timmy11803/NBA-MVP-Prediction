## NBA MVP Prediction 

## Executive Summary:

This project features an HTML scrape off of the basketball reference website with BeautifulSoup and Selenium in order to extract all individual player, MVP voting, and Team statistics. Throughout the data cleaning and transformation process, I appropriately deal with nulls, dups in a should-be-unique column, and string data that should be split into multiple columns. I create dictionaries, functions, and visualizations that help me understand the distribution and values of data. Lastly, I developed an ML model in order to predict future MVP's of the NBA based on their previous stats and MVP voting.
