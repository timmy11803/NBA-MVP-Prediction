## NBA MVP Prediction 

Throughout the data cleaning and transformation process, I appropriately deal with nulls, dups in a should-be-unique column, and string data that should be split into multiple columns. I create dictionaries, functions, and visualizations that help me understand the distribution and values of data.
Developed an ML model in order to predict future MVP's of the NBA based on their previous stats and MVP voting.
